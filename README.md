# Popular-Stocks

A website I developed a few years back and recently uploaded to GitHub. Popular Stocks users see real-time info and comment on the future of various stocks. Each page per stock includes a comment section and uses a user voting system to display the overall public opinion on the given stock. Made with HTML, PHP, and SQL.
